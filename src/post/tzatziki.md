description: Mediterranean food is some of the best. Luckily most things like hummus, tahini, and baba ghanoush are vegan friendly. Tzatziki, which happens to be my favorite, seemed like something I was going to have to learn to live without. This vegan tzatziki recipe is amazing and convinced me that maybe old favorites are not gone for good.

Mediterranean food is some of the best. Luckily most things like hummus, tahini, and baba ghanoush are vegan friendly. Tzatziki, which happens to be my favorite, seemed like something I was going to have to learn to live without. This vegan tzatziki recipe is amazing and convinced me that maybe old favorites are not gone for good.

**Cook time:** 10 minutes

Shopping list:
- Silken tofu
- vegan sour cream
- Lemon Juice
- White wine vinegar
- Garlic
- cucumber
- dill

Ingredients:
- 12 oz of firm silken tofu
- 1/2 cup of vegan sour cream
- 3 tbsp of lemon juice
- 1 tbsp of white wine vinegar
- 1/2 tsp of salt
- 2-3 garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- pepper to taste
- 1 cucumber seeded and grated
- 1 tbsp of chopped dill

Directions:
- In a blender/food processor blend silken tofu, sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar and 1/2 tsp salt.
- When creamy, add chopped garlic and oil. Blend again.
- Taste, add pepper to taste and more salt if needed. Set aside.
- Squeeze the grated cucumber between hands. (Squeeze out as much water as possible.).
- Add cucumber (and herbs, if using) to tofu dip, and stir to blend.
- Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hours.

And it is that simple. The longer this sits in the fridge the more these flavors permeate your tzatziki sauce. I eat this with crackers and now my falafel wraps are exactly how I remember them. Let me know what you think and enjoy! Thanks.
