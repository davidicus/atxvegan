Most people bail when they see that these wings are made with cauliflower but trust me, you have to try them. You will not believe cauliflower can taste this good. Great as a party app but can definitely be made for dinner! Most of the stuff needed for these wings can probably be found in your pantry or fridge right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Cook time:</strong> 45 minutes</p>\n<h2>Ingredients:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>cauliflower - ( one head )</li>\n<li>hot sauce - ( 1/2 cup )</li>\n<li>vegan butter - ( 1 1/2 tbsp )</li>\n<li>agave nectar - ( 1 tbsp )</li>\n<li>unsweetened non-dairy milk - ( 1/2 cup )</li>\n<li>water - ( 1/2 cup )</li>\n<li>flour - ( 3/4 cup )</li>\n<li>salt - ( 1/4 tsp )</li>\n<li>pepper - ( 1/4 tsp )</li>\n<li>onion powder - ( 2 tsp )</li>\n<li>garlic powder - ( 2 tsp )</li>\n<li>cumin - ( 1 tsp )</li>\n<li>paprika - ( 1 tsp )</li>\n<li>cayenne pepper - ( 1/4 tsp )</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Directions</h2>\n<p>First thing you want to do is turn on your oven to 450 degrees. Take a cooking sheet and cover it with parchment paper. If you don't have parchment just spray it with an oil spray. Next, cut up your cauliflower. Chop the heads at the stem and then slice the florets into 1&quot; pieces. The thinner these are the better and the crispier they will be.</p>\n<p>After this is done you will want to mix all the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl.  I use all purpose flour but you could use any flour you like. Once all the dry ingredients are mixed together pour in a 1/2 cup of hemp milk or any non-dairy milk and add 1/2 cup of water. Mix in completely with the dry ingredients. You should have a fairly runny consistency but you want it to stick to the cauliflower. If you feel it't too runny then add another tablespoon of flour. If you think its too thick just add some hot sauce to the mix until you get the desired consistency.</p>\n<p>Now that you have your mixture take your cauliflower florets and dunk them, coating them completely and set them on a cookie sheet. Give each wing a little space as you will need to flip them. Once the cooking sheet if filled up place it in the oven and cook for 35 minutes, flipping half way through.</p>\n<p>Once the wings are done mix the butter, agave nectar, and hot sauce together. Brush the mixture over your wings. You could toss them but I think this keeps them crispier.</p>\n<p>And that is it. Enjoy these bad boys with a nice vegan ranch.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p><img src=\"/static/img/falafel.jpg\" alt=\"Awesome Title\"></p>\n<p>These falafel are so damn good. It takes less than five to prepare this mix. The reason its not a fast meal is because they do take 20 minutes to cook. Trust me, these are worth it. Since they are baked these are super healthy for you and chock full of flavor. Falafel can be enjoyed in a salad or, as I prefer, in a wrap.</p>\n<p><strong>Cook time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>\n<h2>shopping list:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>onion</li>\n<li>chickpeas</li>\n<li>parsley, cilantro</li>\n<li>sweet peppers or bell peppers</li>\n<li>lemon juice</li>\n<li>garlic cloves</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>produce:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1 can of chickpeas drained 19 oz</li>\n<li>1 cup of onion (white/red)</li>\n<li>2 tbsp finely chopped parsley</li>\n<li>2 tbsp finely chopped cilantro</li>\n<li>1/4 cubs of sweet peppers</li>\n<li>4 cloves of garlic</li>\n<li>1 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>spices:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>1 tsp salt</li>\n<li>1  1/2 tsp cumin</li>\n<li>1 tsp of hot red pepper</li>\n<li>1 tsp of pepper</li>\n<li>1 tsp of baking powder</li>\n<li>6 tbsp of flour</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>steps:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>combine all produce and all spices except baking powder and flour into processor and pulse for a rough chop, combining but not puree.</li>\n<li>add the baking powder and flour to mix and pulse till incorporated.</li>\n<li>spray coconut spray into muffin tin to prevent sticking.</li>\n<li>transfer mix into bowl and roll little balls and put into small muffin tin. It should roll with minimum sticking to the hands. If its real sticky add flour little at a time till its rolling and not leaving huge chunks</li>\n<li>put into oven at 400 degrees and bake for 20 mins</li>\n<li>flip halfway through</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these are done cooking take them out and allow them to cool. Throw these into a wrap or salad with Tahini, hummus and my vegan tzatziki sauce. Trader Joe's actually has an amazing tahini and hummus and I highly recommend. I hope you enjoyed these delicious falafel. Please let me know your thoughts in the comments. Thank!</p>\n",
