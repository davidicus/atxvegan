Luckily most things like hummus, tahini, and baba ghanoush are vegan friendly. Tzatziki, which happens to be my favorite, seemed like something I was going to have to learn to live without. This vegan tzatziki recipe is amazing and convinced me that maybe old favorites are not gone for good.</p>\n<p><strong>Cook time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>\n<p>Shopping list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Silken tofu</li>\n<li>vegan sour cream</li>\n<li>Lemon Juice</li>\n<li>White wine vinegar</li>\n<li>Garlic</li>\n<li>cucumber</li>\n<li>dill</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>12 oz of firm silken tofu</li>\n<li>1/2 cup of vegan sour cream</li>\n<li>3 tbsp of lemon juice</li>\n<li>1 tbsp of white wine vinegar</li>\n<li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>\n<li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>\n<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>\n<li>pepper to taste</li>\n<li>1 cucumber seeded and grated</li>\n<li>1 tbsp of chopped dill</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Directions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In a blender/food processor blend silken tofu, sour cream, lemon juice, vinegar and 1/2 tsp salt.</li>\n<li>When creamy, add chopped garlic and oil. Blend again.</li>\n<li>Taste, add pepper to taste and more salt if needed. Set aside.</li>\n<li>Squeeze the grated cucumber between hands. (Squeeze out as much water as possible.).</li>\n<li>Add cucumber (and herbs, if using) to tofu dip, and stir to blend.</li>\n<li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And it is that simple. The longer this sits in the fridge the more these flavors permeate your tzatziki sauce. I eat this with crackers and now my falafel wraps are exactly how I remember them. Let me know what you think and enjoy! Thanks.</p>\n",
